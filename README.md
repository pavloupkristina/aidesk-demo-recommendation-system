# aiDESK Recommendation System Algorithm Demonstration

As part of the Bridges of Solidarity Hackathon 2020, we are proposing a help desk-inspired ticketing system that maximises the possibility of donors seeing and addressing tickets that are most fitting to them by implementing a content-based recommendation system algorithm.

The recommendation system algorithm will be trained to match the tickets' descriptions to the keywords on donor profiles. It will also track past tickets addressed by each donor to learn and be refined so that it becomes more accurate and successful over time.

This Python code is a simple, high-level implementation of what we aim the system to be like.

The results from a very small dataset of ten tickets, created for demonstration purposes, is shown below:
